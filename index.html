                <p id="box-text">Welcome to Riddle me This, a quiz where you have to solve 5 riddles as fast as possible in order to score points. 
                    The riddles are selected from a large pool at random everytime you start the game giving you a new and fun experience each time! 
                    A timer will keep track of how long you take to answer each riddle. The faster you find the correct answer, the 
                    more point you will reiceive. Beware though that the timer will start running the moment you hit play! After solving the riddle a 
                    "proceed" button wil appear that can bring you to the next riddle. The timer will once again start when you click the button.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You can keep track of your current score and the amount of right & wrong answers on the left side of the screen. There will also be a forfeit button to give up on your current run.
                    Got stuck on a riddle but want to finish the run? There is a reveal answer button right above the timer on the bottom left of the game screen. You won't earn any points for that riddle though!
                    <br>
                    <br> 
                    Each question also provides you with a clue of the type of answer that is required, which can either be a word, a sentence, or a number.

                    <br>
                    Do you believe you got what it takes to conquer the leaderboards?
